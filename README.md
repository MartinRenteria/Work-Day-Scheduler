<b>05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler</b>
Create a simple calendar application that allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

You'll need to use the Moment.js library to work with date and time. Be sure to read the documentation carefully and concentrate on using Moment.js in the browser.

<b>User Story</b>
Implement the following user story:

AS AN employee with a busy schedule
<br>
I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
<br>
SO THAT I can manage my time effectively
<br>
<b>Acceptance Criteria</b?>
<br>
Aim to meet the following acceptance criteria:
<br>
GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
<br>
WHEN I open the planner
<br>
THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
<br>
WHEN I scroll down
<br>
THEN I am presented with timeblocks for standard business hours
<br>
WHEN I view the timeblocks for that day
<br>
THEN each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
<br>
WHEN I click into a timeblock
<br>
THEN I can enter an event
<br>
WHEN I click the save button for that timeblock
<br>
THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
<br>
WHEN I refresh the page
<br>
THEN the saved events persist
<br>
The following animation demonstrates the application functionality:

A user clicks on slots on the color-coded calendar and edits the events.
