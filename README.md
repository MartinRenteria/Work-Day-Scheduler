# Work-Day-Scheduler

# Description
This application is a daily planner for an average work day or as a basic scheduler. The application features the moments.js API to capture real time information. As time passes, it will set the background color of each timeslot to indicate past time, current hour, or if the timeslot has not passed. Additionally, you are able to save your notes within each timeslot and come back to it later to review your agenda for the day. This project demonstrates my skill and knowledge in applying API's, JQuery, and Bootstrap.
